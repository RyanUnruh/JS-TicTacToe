* How to run
Navigate to your HTML file in your browser to play.

* Assumptions
I assumed by the two players, described in the instructions, to be two players on the same device taking turns clicking. 

 * Constraints
I would have liked to include an AI player but did not attempt due to time constraints.

I also wanted to use the extra days after finishing this challenge in vanilla JS to attempt in React. Upon realizing that I am to new to React to finish on time and with confidence, I chose to deliver this version.
